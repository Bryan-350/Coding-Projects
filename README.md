## üí° Featured Projects

### üìå Database Design and Implementation for Mock Business  
**Date:** April 2025  
**Tech:** MySQL, AWS EC2/RDS, SQL, Agile

Led an Agile-based team in designing, implementing, and testing a MySQL database for a simulated retail business. Built a fully normalized relational schema with proper constraints, wrote custom SQL queries for business insights, and deployed the solution using **AWS RDS** (database hosting) and **EC2** (Linux instance for remote access and testing). Delivered a comprehensive stakeholder report outlining system functionality, data flow, and operational use cases.

### üìå Banking Predictive Analytics Report  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Tech:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

Performed a full-cycle analysis of customer behavior using a mock banking dataset. Cleaned and prepared data using **Pandas**, visualized trends with **Matplotlib**, and implemented machine learning models (logistic regression, classification) using **Scikit-learn**. Produced a concise report delivering actionable insights to support data-driven marketing strategies and customer targeting.

### üìå Custom C++ Hash Map Implementation  
**Date:** August 2024  
**Tech:** C++, Class Templates, Dynamic Memory, CLI

Designed and implemented a custom `hashMap` class using class templates, dual hashing, and separate chaining to replicate the behavior of `unordered_map`. Managed dynamic resizing, memory deallocation, and deep copying to reinforce low-level systems knowledge. Paired with a CLI-driven test program to classify descriptions based on keyword-category mappings, simulating a rule-based tagging system.

### üìå Amortization Calculator  
**Date:** November 2022  
**Tech:** Java, OOP, File Output, GUI (JOptionPane)

Built a standalone Java application that calculates and outputs loan amortization schedules. Utilized encapsulated class design to handle financial logic and user input through a simple GUI interface. Output was formatted into structured reports showing interest and principal breakdowns per payment ‚Äî reinforcing strong command over class design, control flow, and file handling.

### üìå Graph Path Finder (C++)  
**Date:** February 2024  
**Tech:** C++, STL, Recursion, DFS

Created a C++ program that determines whether a valid path exists between two graph nodes given stamina constraints. Parsed edge data into an adjacency list and used a recursive **depth-first search** (DFS) approach to track the valid path. If a path is found, the program reconstructs and prints it; otherwise, it returns a failure message. Reinforced understanding of recursion, backtracking, and graph traversal logic.

### üìå Sales Data Analyzer (C++)  
**Date:** October 2022  
**Tech:** C++, File Parsing, CLI, Arrays

Developed a menu-based command-line program that parses item-level retail data from a CSV file and outputs various metrics: best-selling item, highest margin, and most profitable product. Implemented core logic using parallel arrays and structured control flows. This foundational project introduced early experience with file I/O, data formatting, and reporting.

## üöÄ What‚Äôs Next

I'm actively building on this foundation by exploring projects in:

- **Front-end development** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to build a responsive portfolio website ‚Äî focused on showcasing projects, improving UI/UX skills, and gaining hands-on experience with custom styling and layout design without relying on no-code platforms.

- **Full-stack application development** using **React** with **Node.js/Express** or **Java** with **Spring Boot**, and **relational databases** such as **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL**, utilizing **JavaScript** or **Java** throughout the stack.

- **Advanced C++ applications** with an emphasis on memory safety, performance optimization, and modern design patterns.

- **Machine learning modeling** using **Python** and libraries like **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy**, focusing on supervised learning techniques such as classification and regression to uncover patterns, generate predictions, and support data-driven decision-making.
