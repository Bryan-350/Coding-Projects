# Coding-Projects
This is just a collection of projects/assignments I have done. It shows my ability to think logically and write code to effectively create solutions. These first two programs display my understanding of the basics of programming such as functions, control structures, file I/O, command line argument input, classes, object oriented programming, as well as code modularization. The more recent ones display my understanding of more concepts such as recursion, memory allocation, depth first search, and more. I look forward to adding more projects/assignments in the future in not only Java and C++, but also JavaScript and Python.
