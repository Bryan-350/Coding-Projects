# Coding-Projects
This collection of projects and assignments highlights my ability to think logically, analyze data, and write code to develop effective solutions. The first two programs demonstrate my grasp of foundational programming concepts, including functions, control structures, file I/O, command-line argument input, classes, object-oriented programming, and code modularization. The more recent projects showcase my understanding of advanced topics such as recursion, memory allocation, graph traversal using depth-first search, and other data structures and algorithms.

Additionally, I completed a comprehensive data analysis report for a Big Data Analytics course, where I analyzed a dataset (BankSet.csv) for a simulated bank. Using Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, I cleaned and explored the data, created visualizations to uncover trends, and implemented machine learning models to predict which customers were likely to purchase a term deposit product. This project demonstrated my ability to apply data-driven insights to solve practical problems and optimize decision-making strategies.

I look forward to expanding this portfolio with more projects and assignments, not only in Java and C++ but also in Python, JavaScript, and other modern technologies.
